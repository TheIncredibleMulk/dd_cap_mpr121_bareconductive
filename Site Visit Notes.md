# Notes from 6/19/21 visit

- Small fat warpbeam closest to Main St. needs it's touch sensing recalibrated? It wouldn't run the sound and the lights when touched consistently, especially compared to the other warpbeams. It also would not light up or make sound while in 'not textile mode'. (could be bogus data I was only out there for 30 min)
- It feels really weird that you can only have one sound / warpbeam playing at a time. Is this intended? Is this because FPP can only run one playlist at a time? Is there way to let them all be playable?
- Honestly I feel like the show interupts a very nice organic activity that's happening out there. Can we add more touches? We'll need to run this by Yuri/DeeDee.
- There's a case/situation where, when you trigger a show with a 'long' 'drum sound' it delays the lighting track from the music track and the lighting plays the whole show out of sync. Can we add some error checking to eliminate this?
