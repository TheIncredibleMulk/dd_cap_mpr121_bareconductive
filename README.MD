# hopefully a final working version of the project.

Sensing code is pulled from Bare Conductive's MPR121 library. Bless those folks.

## Notes from 6/19/21 visit

- Small fat warpbeam closest to Main St. Needs it's touch sensing recalibrated? It wouldn't run the sound and the lights when touched consistently, especially compared to the other warpbeams
- It feels really weird that you can only have one sound / warpbeam playing at a time. Is this intended? Is this because FPP can only run one playlist at a time? Is there way to let them all be playable?
- Honestly I feel like the show interupts a very nice organic activity that's happening out there
- There's a case/situation where, when you trigger a show with a 'long' 'drum sound' it delays the lighting track from the music track and the lighting plays the whole show out of sync. Can we add some error checking to eliminate this?
